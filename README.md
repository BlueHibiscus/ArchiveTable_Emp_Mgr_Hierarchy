TO GENERATE EMPLOYEE-MANAGER HIERARCHY RECURSIVE STORED PROCEDURE IS WRITTEN. RECURSION CAN BE DEFINED AS A METHOD OF PROBLEM SOLVING WHEREIN THE SOLUTION IS ARRIVED AT BY REPETITIVELY APPLYING IT TO SUBSETS OF THE PROBLEM.

EACH TIME A STORED PROCEDURE CALLS ANOTHER STORED PROCEDURE.THE NESTING LEVEL IS INCREMENTED. WHEN THE MAXIMUM OF 32 IS EXCEEDED, THE TRANSACTION IS TEMINATED.

TO CAPTURE THE EMPLOYEE-MANAGER-HIERARCHY, THIS RECURSIVE STORED PROCEDURE IS EXECUTED, PRIMARILY TO CHECK WHO IS WORKING UNDER WHOM AFTER EVERY TRANSACTIONS.

THE SECOND STORED PROCEDURE SEGGREGATES THE BASE TABLE WITH ARCHIVE TABLE.THE BASE TABLE HAS A LOT OF CURRENT AND HISTORIC DATA THAT ARE OFTEN UNREFFERED, HENCE AN ARCHIVE TABLE IS CREATED DYNAMICALLY TO STORE OLD UNREFERRED DATA WHILE THE BASE TABLE STORES RECENT CURRENT DATA OF THE EMPLOYEES. CREATING ARCHIVE TABLE FROM BASE TABLE NOT JUST SEGGREGATES THE OLD UNUSED RECORDS FROM THE CURRENT RECORDS BUT ALSO PERFORMS A QUICK TABLE SCAN AND IMPROVES PERFORMANCE TUNING IN THE BASE TABLE.

EMPLOYEES HIRED IN OR BEFORE THE YEAR 2012 ARE NOW STORED AS HISTORIC DATA IN ARCHIVE TABLE WHILE THE EMPLOYEES HIRED AFTER THE YEAR 2012 RESIDE IN BASE TABLE AS CURRENT DATA. USER DEFINED COLUMN "ACTIVE" OF BIT DATATYPE STORES DATA ONLY IN THE NUMBER AS 0 OR 1. HERE 1 REPRESENTS AS ACTIVE EMPLOYEE, FOR EXAMPLE IF A EMPLOYEE WAS HIRED BEFORE 2012 BUT HAS AN ACTIVE STATUS AS 1, THEN THIS EMPLOYEE'S RECORD WILL NOT BE INSERTED INTO ARCHIVE TABLE BUT WILL REMAIN IN BASE TABLE.

THE THIRD STORED PROCEDURE PERFORMS VARIOUS TRANSACTIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY. WHHEN A NEW DATA ENTRY OF A EMPLOYEE IS INSERTED IN THE BASE TABLE, THE OLDEST RECORD RESIDING IN BASE TABLE IS DELETED FROM THE BASE TABLE INTO THE ARCHIVE TABLE. THIS RECORD IS NOW A NEW DATA ENTRY IN THE ARCHIVE TABLE. AT THE SAME TIME THE OLDEST RECORD IN THE ARCHIVE TABLE IS ALSO DELETED PERMANENTLY NOT ONLY FROM ARCHIVE TABLE BUT ALSO FROM THE DATABASE IMPLICITLY.

THUS, THERE IS AN ENTIRE CHAIN OF INSERT AND DELETE TRANSACTIONS IMPLICITLY PERFORMANCED EITHER IN THE BASE TABLE, ARCHIVE TABLE OR BOTH.
   
TO VALIDATE AND TEST THE DATA INTEGRITY AND TO AVOID UNAUTHENTIC DATA INSERTIONS, CODE IS WRITTEN TO CHECK VARIOUS VALIDATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, NEW DATA ENTRY OF ANY EMPLOYEE HIRED AFTER THE YEAR 2015 WILL NOT BE INSERTED IN THE BASE TABLE.

RECURSIVE STORED PRCEDURE ARE BENIFICIAL TO CHECK THE CONSTANTLY CHANGING EMPLOYEE-MANAGER-HIERARCHY AFTER EVERY FEW NEW DATA ENTRIES.
